# wwn.se

A custom browser startpage built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a search bar with keyboard-driven command shortcuts, auto-suggestions, a clock, and quick-access links to frequently used services.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – single-page layout (`index.html`)
- **CSS3** – styling with CSS custom properties for theming (`css/style.css`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – no frameworks, no build step
- **External API** – DuckDuckGo search suggestions (fetched client-side via JSONP)
- **Storage** – `localStorage` for persisting user preferences

There are no npm dependencies, bundlers, or build tools. The site is entirely static.

## Running Locally

No install or build is required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser:

```sh
# Using Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js (npx)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

> **Note:** DuckDuckGo suggestions require an HTTP server; they will not load from `file://` URLs due to CORS restrictions.

## Configuration

All settings live in `js/config.js` inside the `CONFIG` object.

### Commands

Each command has the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                              | Required |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `category`    | Group shown in the help menu (omit to hide from help)    | No       |
| `name`        | Display name                                             | Yes      |
| `key`         | Shortcut key (e.g. `m` for Mail). `*` is the fallback   | Yes      |
| `url`         | Base URL to navigate to                                  | Yes      |
| `search`      | Search path appended to `url`; `{}` is the query placeholder | No   |
| `color`       | Background color/gradient shown when the command matches  | No       |
| `icon`        | *(unused)* Icons are now auto-fetched via Google Favicon API | No       |
| `quickLaunch` | Include in quick-launch (`q!`) batch open                 | No       |

Example – add a command for GitHub:

```js
{
  category: 'Dev',
  name: 'GitHub',
  key: 'g',
  url: 'https://github.com',
  search: '/search?q={}',
  color: '#333',
  icon: 'github',
  quickLaunch: true,
}
```

Usage: type `g:react` to search GitHub for "react", or just `g` to open github.com.

### Suggestion Influencers

The `influencers` array controls where suggestions come from and their priority:

| Influencer   | Source                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Commands`   | Matches against configured command keys    |
| `Default`    | Static suggestions defined in `defaultSuggestions` |
| `DuckDuckGo` | Live search suggestions from DuckDuckGo   |
| `History`    | Previously entered queries (localStorage)  |

Adjust the `limit` for each influencer to control how many suggestions it contributes.

### Other Settings
